For this project (done as part of The Odin Project Foundations course), I was supposed to make a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch, but I decided to make a simple paint application instead.

The webpage works fairly well when using a modern version of google chrome or firefox on my 22â€³ 1920x1080 desktop monitor, and hopefully it will work OK for other web browsers and for desktop monitors of other sizes and resolutions (I haven't properly covered responsive web page design yet). Event listeners for the canvas listen for mouse events, so I don't expect the page to work for mobile and tablet devices.

You can view the web page for this project via the following link: https://rednaxelam.github.io/etch-a-sketch/

Haven't studied JavaScript objects in much depth at the time of writing this (they will be covered in the next lesson in the course), so the code doesn't make full use of them.
